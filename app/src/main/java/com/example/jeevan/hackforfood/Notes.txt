TODO:
Implement a rest api and fetch data from there.
Order merging.
User page and other settings.

Current implementation:
- just to show off the concept
- focus on basic functionality, and UI
    user selects an occasion, then sees various lists of orders for that occasion, like popular, from restaurants etc.
    can order only under once occasion, if he goes back to occasions page, the order will be cleared
    can put other items in the order apart from the occasion's items.


Thought on future enhancements:
- replicate the full fledged app and add this occasion based page as a tab in that. Then, plug in all the enhancements they might be doing
    like personalized search results based on location, choice of items in orders.

- In Home Page, showing only trending orders for now, which is statically put in the main layout page.
    instead, use a list of categories, like editor's picks, trending, recent etc.
    put it in a list

- Implement a user page to show their previous orders, other settings.

- Implement user ratings.

TODO:



Current implementation:
- just to show off the concept
- focus on basic functionality, and UI
    user selects an occasion, then sees various lists of orders for that occasion, like popular, from restaurants etc.
    can order only under once occasion, if he goes back to occasions page, the order will be cleared
    can put other items in the order apart from the occasion's items.


Thought on future enhancements:
- can plug in some personalization stuff like location based search results etc.
- machine learning for recommended orders.
- Currently, the user selects an occasion, and orders under only that occasion
  Can extend it for multiple occasions.
  And, when the user first enters, he sees the occasions page
   Can extend it to show the orders home page, like play store
   Then, in categories, we can show trending in Occasion1, Trending in Occasion2 and so on..
   Maybe, some other like recommended for you, Editor's choice, Custom orders from restaurants etc.


Technical:
- for now, only showing one Trending orders section
    make it into a recycler view with data coming for various sections.

- like play store, try combining search screen on the home page

- include order rating also, maybe build a system to give ratings and all.

# HackForFood
An android practice app. Main concept is of theme based food ordering.
This app was developed initially as part of a hackathon for an online food ordering company.
And now, I am using it as a practice app to develop my skills on UI, using images, project management, Rest API usage, user authentication, best practices etc.

So, think of an entire food ordering app. HackForFood implements a separate tab in that for a theme/occasion based ordering.
